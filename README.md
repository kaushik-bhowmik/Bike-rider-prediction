# Bike-rider-prediction
Abstract: Deep learning models can be trained for better utilization of resources/ maximizing the business profits like they can used for managing demands, prediction of events like weather forecast.
In this project, I have used the bike riders dataset and used deep learning model for predicting the number of bike riders of any random day. 

The pipeline for this project:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets.
3. Creation of neural networks.
4. Training and validation of the model.
5. Performance evaluation of the model.
